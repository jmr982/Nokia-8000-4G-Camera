# KaiOS 2.5 camera application
## The project
The app is developed for Nokia 8000 4G feature phones. I started the project in 2022 after purchasing the phone. My biggest issue with the phone was the stock camera and its lack of controls. I had just started studying software development and thought that it would be a good practice project to write a camera app. I quickly hacked together a working prototype, and after using it for the summer without issues, I decided to share the project on GitHub.

Fast forward to 2024. I have since graduated and thought it would be interesting to revisit the project. I spent about a day trying to figure out what the code was actually doing. My comments were not helpful. So instead of adding new features to the app, I decided to just refactor the code and write comments. The main objective was to improve readability and make the code easier to further develop. It's far from perfect, but hopefully better than it was before. 

## The app
The main difference to the stock camera, apart from being bare-bones, is the addition of manual controls for features such as exposure, iso, metering, and white balance.Â
